    "# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:\n",
    "1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.\n",
    "2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.\n",
    "3. Define the start and goal locations.\n",
    "4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.\n",
    "5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.\n",
    "6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].\n",
    "7. Write it up.\n",

    "## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) Points\n",
    "### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Writeup / README\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explain the Starter Code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Explain the functionality of what's provided in `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`\n",
    "These scripts contain a basic planning implementation that includes the following contents:\n",
    "* The main code to command the drone like the 'backyardflyer' project\n",
    "* Event programming: There will be a transition between different flying states like 'TakeOff', 'Arming', 'Landing', etc. In this strategy, the drone can be responsive accordingly even though there is an obstacle while it is flying.\n",
    "* Grid creation: Based on the given data, the function 'crate_grid' created a grid space, in which the obstacle is marked as `1`\n",
    "* Searching Algorithm: A* searching algorithm is used to search the closest path to the targeted position\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Set your global home position\n",
    "I use `np.loadtxt` to read the data of `colliders.csv` and make the data type to be String. `[0]` is used to only retrive the first row data which is the global home position. In order to get the numeric value, I used the function `split()` to split the string like `lat0 37.792480` by space and then only read the numeric value. Finally, I convert the data type from 'String' to 'Float' through `float()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "    # TODO: read lat0, lon0 from colliders into floating point values\n",
    "    lat0, lon0= np.loadtxt('colliders.csv', delimiter=',', dtype='str', usecols = (0,1))[0]\n",
    "    lat0 = float(lat0.split()[1])\n",
    "    lon0 = float(lon0.split()[1])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # TODO: set home position to (lon0, lat0, 0)\n",
    "    self.set_home_position(lon0, lat0, 0)\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Set your current local position\n",
    "I set the local position relative to the global home position using the following line:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "        global_home = self.global_home\n",
    "\n",
    "        # TODO: retrieve current global position\n",
    "        global_position = self.global_position\n",
    " \n",
    "        # TODO: convert to current local position using global_to_local()\n",
    "        local_position = global_to_local(global_position, global_home)\n",
    "```\n",
    "I used the function `global_to_local` with two parameters `global_position` and `global_home` to convert the global position to local position, which is relative position with respect to home position.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Set grid start position from local position\n",
    "This is another step in adding flexibility to the start location. As long as it works you're good to go!\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "start = (int(current_local_pos[0]+north_offset),\n",
    "int(current_local_pos[1]+east_offset))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I have taken into account the north and east offset on the map to find the place in the grid.\n",
    "#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords\n",
    "The goal is set using the two lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        # TODO: adapt to set goal as latitude / longitude position and convert\n",
    "        goal_global_position = (-122.39827005, 37.79639587, 0)\n",
    "        goal_local_position = global_to_local(goal_global_position, global_home)\n",
    "        grid_goal = (int(goal_local_position - north_offset),int(goal_local_position[1] - east_offset))\n",
    "        print('Local Start and Goal: ', grid_start, grid_goal)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see the input is in geodetic coordinates `(-122.39827005, 37.79639587, 0)` from which I retrieve the local coordinates using `global_to_local`. The user can also select their goal from running the script with arguments s:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python motion_planning.py --lat 37.79639587 --lon\n",
    "-122.39827005\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This was done by adding two arguments:\n",
    "```\n",
    "parser.add_argument('--lat', type=float, default=1000, help=\"latitude\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "parser.add_argument('--lon', type=float, default=1000, help=\"latitude\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)\n",
    "Instead of using the grid search, I modified the A* to be adaptive to graph space search.\n",
    "Firstly I modifed the function `create_grid` with adding following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # create a voronoi graph based on the location of obstacle centres\n",
    "    graph = Voronoi(points)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The intension of the code above is try to extract the voronoi graph based on the obstacle center points. Then I also checked each edge of the gragh to see if it is in free space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, I added weight for graph as following:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "    # Add weight to graph\n",
    "    G = nx.Graph()\n",
    "    for e in edges:\n",
    "        p1 = tuple(e[0])\n",
    "        p2 = tuple(e[1])\n",
    "        dist = LA.norm(np.array(p2) - np.array(p1))\n",
    "        G.add_edge(p1, p2, weight=dist)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the final step before starting our A* search is trying to find the closest start & goal points in the graph using `closest_point`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I modified the A* initial code for grid space to be:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        for next_node in graph[current_node]:\n",
    "            cost = graph.edges[current_node, next_node]['weight']\n",
    "            branch_cost = current_cost + cost\n",
    "            queue_cost = branch_cost + h(next_node, goal)\n",
    "\n",
    "        if next_node not in visited:                \n",
    "            visited.add(next_node)               \n",
    "            branch[next_node] = (branch_cost, current_node)\n",
    "            queue.put((queue_cost, next_node))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Cull waypoints \n",
    "In collinearity I select continuous groups of points (3 in each step) to see if they belong in a line or approximately belong to a line. If they can be connected to a line I replace the two waypoints with a single one (longer) and continue the search to see if I can add more way points to the same line. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def point(p):\n",
    "    return np.array([p[0], p[1], 1.]).reshape(1, -1)\n",
    "\n",
    "def prune_path(path):\n",
    "    pruned_path = [p for p in path]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    i = 0\n",
    "    while i < len(pruned_path) - 2:\n",
    "        p1 = point(pruned_path[i])\n",
    "        p2 = point(pruned_path[i+1])\n",
    "        p3 = point(pruned_path[i+2])\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # If the 3 points are in a line remove\n",
    "        # the 2nd point.\n",
    "        # The 3rd point now becomes and 2nd point\n",
    "        # and the check is redone with a new third point\n",
    "        # on the next iteration.\n",
    "        if collinearity_check(p1, p2, p3):\n",
    "            # Something subtle here but we can mutate\n",
    "            # `pruned_path` freely because the length\n",
    "            # of the list is check on every iteration.\n",
    "            pruned_path.remove(pruned_path[i+1])\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            i += 1\n",
    "    return pruned_path\n",
