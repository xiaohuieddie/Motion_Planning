    "# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:\n",
    "1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.\n",
    "2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.\n",
    "3. Define the start and goal locations.\n",
    "4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.\n",
    "5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.\n",
    "6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].\n",
    "7. Write it up.\n",

    "### Writeup / README\n",

    "#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.\n",

    "#### 1. Explain the functionality of what's provided in `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`\n",
    "These scripts contain a basic planning implementation that includes...\n",

    "#### 1. Set your global home position\n",
    "Here students should read the first line of the csv file, extract lat0 and lon0 as floating point values and use the self.set_home_position() method to set global home. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is a lovely picture of our downtown San Francisco environment from above!\n",

    "#### 2. Set your current local position\n",
    "Here as long as you successfully determine your local position relative to global home you'll be all set. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.\n",

    "Meanwhile, here's a picture of me flying through the trees!\n",
    "![Forest Flying](./misc/in_the_trees.png)\n",

    "#### 3. Set grid start position from local position\n",
    "This is another step in adding flexibility to the start location. As long as it works you're good to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords\n",
    "This step is to add flexibility to the desired goal location. Should be able to choose any (lat, lon) within the map and have it rendered to a goal location on the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)\n",
    "Minimal requirement here is to modify the code in planning_utils() to update the A* implementation to include diagonal motions on the grid that have a cost of sqrt(2), but more creative solutions are welcome. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Cull waypoints \n",
    "For this step you can use a collinearity test or ray tracing method like Bresenham. The idea is simply to prune your path of unnecessary waypoints. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.\n",

    "### Execute the flight\n",
    "#### 1. Does it work?\n",
